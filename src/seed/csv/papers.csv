This suggests that ALC was effective in normalizing the alterations in cortisol levels that are often associated with depression. Thus, ALC had a positive impact on regulating cortisol, which is a key stress hormone often disrupted in depressive disorders.

The decrease in gray matter choline-containing compounds (P < 0.05) could also imply a beneficial effect on brain metabolism, which is closely linked to mitochondrial function. However, the study did not demonstrate significant effects on other clinically relevant variables such as muscle strength or resting lactate levels, indicating that the improvement in mitochondrial function may be limited to specific areas.
