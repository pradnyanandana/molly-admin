Arginine,,,,,,,,D,D,D,D,C,F,D,0,"L-arginine supplementation in healthy young men led to better exercise performance by increasing blood nitrite levels, lowering blood pressure, reducing the effort needed for moderate exercise, and allowing them to exercise longer at high intensity.,The study found that taking L-Citrulline supplements can help healthy adult men perform better in intense cycling exercises, breathe more efficiently, and lower their blood pressure, while L-Arginine supplements did not show similar benefits.,The study demonstrates that L-arginine supplementation significantly improved pain-free walking distance in patients with intermittent claudication, indicating a reduction in pain associated with peripheral arterial occlusive disease.,lthough the study indicates that L-citrulline supplementation raises plasma L-arginine concentration and augments nitric oxide (NO)-dependent signaling, which could theoretically influence exercise performance, the study does not specifically measure or report on direct exercise performance outcomes. The lack of improvement in flow-mediated vasodilation (FMD) over baseline suggests no direct evidence of improved exercise performance as measured in this study.

Both the beta-alanine (BA) and placebo (PL) groups experienced elevated cortisol levels following exercise compared to baseline, but no significant differences were found between these two groups at any time point post-exercise.,The study demonstrates that creatine plus beta-alanine supplementation led to significantly greater improvements in lean body mass and percent body fat reduction, as well as strength enhancements, compared to either creatine alone or placebo.,Creatine improves muscle power and strength. Combining betaine with creatine also shows improvement, but not more than creatine alone. ,Betaine by itself doesn't make a difference in muscle power, strength, or body composition.,Only the combination of creatine and beta-alanine (CrBa) showed a significant time effect on some parameters, suggesting potential benefits of the combination, not beta-alanine alone.,In summary, the study suggests HIIT is an effective method to improve maximal oxygen uptake, but beta-alanine supplementation did not show additional benefits beyond the placebo in terms of VO2 peak.,betaA supplementation for 28 days enhanced sub-maximal endurance performance by delaying OBLA. However, betaA supplemented individuals had a reduced aerobic capacity as evidenced by the decrease in VO2max values post supplementation.,Combining beta-alanine supplements with short, intense workouts significantly improved endurance, the amount of work done, and muscle mass in young, active men, while those who only exercised and took a placebo did not see as much improvement.,The systematic review and meta-analysis of beta-alanine (BA) supplementation studies indicate a positive effect on physical performance in aerobic-anaerobic transition zones. Specifically, there was a small but significant improvement in the Time Trial Test (TTT) and a large effect in the Limited Distance Test (LDT). These results suggest that BA supplementation can statistically improve exercise performance in these specific areas.,However, it also states that isometric endurance and 400-m race time were not affected by the supplementation. Therefore, while beta-alanine supplementation improved certain measures of exercise performance, it did not enhance overall exercise performance across all the tested parameters.,The abstract indicates that beta-alanine supplementation significantly improved dynamic knee extension torque during the fourth and fifth bouts of maximal voluntary knee extensions, suggesting a benefit in specific aspects of exercise performance related to fatigue resistance in repeated dynamic contractions.,Taking beta-alanine supplements increased muscle carnosine and made the athletes' muscles less tired during certain exercises, but it didn’t help them run faster or improve endurance in holding a contraction.,In line with the purported mechanisms for an ergogenic effect of β-alanine supplementation, exercise lasting 60-240 s was improved (P=0.001) in BA compared to Pla, as was exercise of >240 s (P=0.046). In contrast, there was no benefit of β-alanine on exercise lasting <60 s (P=0.312). The median effect of β-alanine supplementation is a 2.85% (-0.37 to 10.49%) improvement in the outcome of an exercise measure, when a median total of 179 g of β-alanine is supplemented.,β-Alanine supplementation helped college wrestlers and football players perform better and gain more muscle during 8 weeks of intense training compared to those who didn’t take the supplement. Football players saw the most improvement.,β-alanine supplementation elevated muscle carnosine content by 45.3% in soleus and 28.2% in gastrocnemius, and improved the 2,000-m rowing performance of the elite rowers by 4.3 seconds.,beta-alanine supplementation appears to have a minimal or unclear effect on swimming performance in real-world training and competition settings, both in terms of actual performance times and physiological markers in the blood.,5 weeks of beta-alanine supplementation showed no improvement in repeat sprint performance, including peak and mean horizontal power.

Specifically, CRE + CAF resulted in higher mean and peak power during Sprints 1 and 2 compared to CRE + PLA, and during Sprints 1 and 3 compared to CON. Additionally, creatine loading alone (CRE + PLA) also resulted in significantly greater mean and peak power during Sprint 3 compared to CON.,It was the combination of carnitine (CAR) and caffeine (CAF+CAR) that significantly increased exercise endurance time compared to CON, CAF, or CAR alone, suggesting the enhanced performance was more attributable to the combination rather than caffeine alone.,The abstract does not support the conclusion that caffeine statistically improved exercise performance in the context of lactate, ventilatory, and heart rate variability thresholds during progressive exercise. Although caffeine increased some physiological parameters at rest (such as blood lactate, oxygen consumption, carbon dioxide production, and minute ventilation), these changes did not translate into significant improvements in the key performance metrics during exercise. The only noted difference during exercise was higher minute ventilation volumes in caffeine trials, but other parameters (including lactate, ventilatory, and heart rate variability thresholds) did not show significant differences compared to placebo tests. Thus, the data suggest that while caffeine alters some physiological responses at rest, it does not significantly enhance exercise performance in terms of the specific metrics evaluated in this study.,People with a certain gene type (AA) got more benefits from drinking caffeine, cycling faster, compared to another gene type (C), before a bike race.,People with a certain gene type (AA) got more benefits from drinking caffeine, cycling faster, compared to another gene type (C), before a bike race.,Caffeine ingestion at both 3 mg x kg(-1) body mass and 6 mg x kg(-1) body mass significantly improved cycling performance by 4.2% and 2.9% respectively, and resulted in significantly higher heart rate values compared to placebo.,Caffeine intake improved cycling performance, independent of whether the environment was warm or cool.,A caffeine dose of at least 3 mg/kg in the form of an energy drink is necessary to significantly improve half-squat and bench-press maximal muscle power.,Caffeine significantly enhanced peak knee flexion torque, knee extension/flexion total work, and knee extension/flexion power during the first bout of high-intensity exercise. The magnitude of performance improvement ranged from 5% to 8% with a 5-mg·kg dose of caffeine.,Caffeine ingestion resulted in increased muscle strength and power output, raising performance levels in the morning to those observed in the afternoon. The results were significant for bar displacement velocity during free-weight full-squat exercises and bench press exercises at 75% 1RM load and for isometric electrically evoked strength of the right knee, along with a significant increase in norepinephrine levels.,Caffeine helped athletes run faster in repeated sprints and maintain that speed the next day, but it didn’t make them more agile or affect their sleep.,However, too much caffeine also increases a stress hormone called cortisol, which can counteract these positive effects.,When caffeine is combined with sodium bicarbonate, gastrointestinal symptoms may prevent performance enhancement, so further investigation of ingestion protocols that minimize side effects is required.,When caffeine is combined with sodium bicarbonate, gastrointestinal symptoms may prevent performance enhancement, so further investigation of ingestion protocols that minimize side effects is required.,When caffeine is combined with sodium bicarbonate, gastrointestinal symptoms may prevent performance enhancement, so further investigation of ingestion protocols that minimize side effects is required.,Caffeine supplementation had no significant effect on peak power, mean power, or time to peak power during sprint cycling.,In this study involving young black African male adults from Nigeria, caffeine did not improve their aerobic power, running time, or the number of laps they could complete in a shuttle run test.,This study revealed that acute caffeine ingestion can significantly enhance performance of prolonged, intermittent-sprint ability in competitive, male, team-sport athletes.,The total amount of sprint work performed during the caffeine trial was 8.5% greater than that performed during the placebo trial in the first half and was 7.6% greater in the second half. ,Taking caffeine before doing intermittent sprints on a bike improved the total sprinting work and peak power for male amateur team-sport athletes compared to when they didn't take caffeine.,Caffeine helps moderately trained young men lift more weight and do more repetitions during bench press exercises, and makes them feel more energetic and less tired than without caffeine. ,Caffeine helps moderately trained young men lift more weight and do more repetitions during bench press exercises, and makes them feel more energetic and less tired than without caffeine. ,The results indicate that the synergistic effects of caffeine and glucose can benefit sustained attention and verbal memory, , Caffeine alone improved simple reaction time, Caffeine significantly impaired motor learning compared to placebo and naps.,When given caffeine, people who are more outgoing (extraverted) showed better memory performance in a specific test. Those who are not outgoing didn't see this benefit.,When given caffeine, people who are more outgoing (extraverted) showed better memory performance in a specific test. Those who are not outgoing didn't see this benefit., The study found a significant intervention effect and a time x intervention interaction for serum cortisol; cortisol concentrations were significantly higher following the caffeinated coffee intervention, , The study revealed that caffeine intake prior to exercise resulted in a dose-dependent increase in testosterone concentration, with the highest dose (800 mg) leading to a 21% increase.,Drinking caffeine before exercise helped professional rugby players work harder, especially when they were tired.,Drinking caffeine before exercise helped professional rugby players work harder, especially when they were tired.,he results of the present study show that caffeine has ergogenic properties with the potential to benefit performance in both single and multiple sprint sports.,Drinking caffeine with a high-fat meal before exercise makes the exercise feel easier and increases a number of body responses like heart rate and oxygen uptake. However, it doesn't make a difference in how long people can exercise before they get exhausted.,Caffeine ingestion with a high fat meal resulted in reduced perceived leg exertion and breathlessness, ,However, this caffeine-induced reduction in effort perception did not improve exercise performance., Drinking caffeine before long exercise sessions helps to keep pleasure levels stable and makes the effort seem less hard for male endurance cyclists. ,Neither low (2 mg/kg) nor high (5 mg/kg) doses of caffeine had a significant effect on leg muscle pain perception ,Caffeine intake at a dose of 5 mg/kg improved various measures of muscle function during high-intensity exercise, such as knee extension and flexion.,Low-dose caffeine was found to significantly decrease the perception of pain during an exhaustive grip task., Coffee consumption led to a decrease in serum concentrations of 8-isoprostane, a marker of oxidative stress (median: -16%; consumption of 8 compared with 0 cups coffee/d).,Drinking coffee daily can help reduce signs of body inflammation and improve good cholesterol levels,When elite rugby players didn't get enough sleep, their passing skills got worse. However, if they took either caffeine or creatine, their skills didn't get worse despite lack of sleep. ,When elite rugby players didn't get enough sleep, their passing skills got worse. However, if they took either caffeine or creatine, their skills didn't get worse despite lack of sleep. ,Drinking caffeinated coffee helps improve mood and attention better than decaffeinated coffee. ,Drinking caffeinated coffee helps improve mood and attention better than decaffeinated coffee. , Caffeine was found to raise alertness, jitteriness, and blood pressure, while theanine helped to lower the caffeine-induced rise in blood pressure. ,The study showed that caffeine helps with global attention and reduces distraction, while theanine helps with local attention and increases distraction.,Ingesting caffeine before exercising in warm environments boosts your adrenaline levels. , It also improved performance in a vigilance task by increasing the number of hits and decreasing reaction times.,The study revealed that caffeine impaired performance on a memory task.,Mood - Caffeine produced feelings of arousal, positive mood, and high.,The combined intake of caffeine and L-theanine did not confer additional benefits over each compound taken alone.,The combined intake of caffeine and L-theanine did not confer additional benefits over each compound taken alone., The ingestion of caffeine and L-theanine individually reduced error rates in tasks requiring sustained attention, Drinking caffeine or L-theanine found in tea helped people make fewer mistakes when doing monotonous tasks over a long time. ,Caffeine alone improved performance on attention tasks and enhanced overall mood ratings.,Caffeine alone improved performance on attention tasks and enhanced overall mood ratings.,Drinking tea with both L-theanine and caffeine helps people pay attention better and make clearer distinctions between different things., However, regularly drinking caffeine doesn't make you more alert overall - it just brings you back to your normal level of alertness if you've stopped consuming it for a while. ,Also, drinking caffeine can cause anxiety and headaches in some people.,The study found that caffeine intake led to increased anxiety in individuals with the rs5751876 TT genotype. However, with frequent consumption, substantial tolerance develops to the anxiogenic effect of caffeine, even in genetically susceptible individuals.,L-Theanine and caffeine in combination led to improvements in rapid visual information processing accuracy, mental fatigue ratings, simple reaction time, numeric working memory reaction time, sentence verification accuracy, and delayed word recognition reaction time. It also decreased headache and tiredness ratings and increased alertness ratings.,The combination of L-theanine and caffeine led to faster numeric working memory reaction time and improved sentence verification accuracy.,Caffeine attenuated increases in self-reported 'mental fatigue'.,The ingestion of 300mg caffeine improved the participants' thermal comfort and reduced their feelings of

Citrulline,,,,,,,,F,D,F,A,C-,D,D,0," Citrulline malate supplementation, at a single 6 g dose pre-workout, does not provide a statistically significant benefit in terms of improving muscle recovery or altering cortisol levels after a session of high-intensity resistance exercise in untrained young adult men. ,Taking Citrulline-malate helped college guys do more chin-ups, reverse chin-ups, and push-ups, and it changed their diastolic blood pressure a bit, but it didn’t do anything for their blood lactate, heart rate, or systolic blood pressure.,Citrulline/Malate supplementation led to a significant 49.8% intra-group decrease and a 60.7% between-group decrease in blood lactate levels, particularly noticeable immediately after exercise, suggesting a potential enhancement in athletic performance and delayed onset of fatigue during excessive or prolonged activity.,Taking citrulline malate helps in doing more repetitions during lower-body exercises, but it doesn’t make a difference in blood lactate, heart rate, or blood pressure compared to not taking it.,The study tested if l-citrulline could help young and older adults use oxygen better while walking. It helped young men use oxygen more quickly when they started exercising, but it didn’t make a difference for women or older adults.,the study demonstrated that L-citrulline supplementation impacted Nitric Oxide (NO) levels. Specifically, the supplementation led to a significant increase in serum nitrogen oxide (NOx, which includes nitrite plus nitrate and is a marker of NO production) in the L-citrulline group (p<0.05).,: L-citrulline-malate supplementation appears to have had a positive impact on certain metabolic parameters related to exercise performance. The supplementation significantly increased the plasma concentrations of citrulline, arginine, ornithine, urea, creatinine, and nitrite (p < 0.05), which are involved in the metabolic handling of amino acids and the production of arginine-derived metabolites. These changes suggest enhanced amino acid utilization and increased production of metabolites beneficial for exercise performance. Additionally, growth hormone increase was higher in the supplemented group post-exercise (p < 0.05), indicating a potential enhancement in exercise-related hormonal response. These factors collectively suggest a positive effect of L-citrulline-malate supplementation on exercise performance, particularly in the context of endurance cycling.,The study found that taking L-Citrulline supplements can help healthy adult men perform better in intense cycling exercises, breathe more efficiently, and lower their blood pressure, while L-Arginine supplements did not show similar benefits.,Acute CM supplementation in recreationally active males provides no ergogenic benefit in aerobic cycling performance followed by an anaerobic cycling test.,No significant positive benefits of citrulline malate supplementation on exercise performance, muscle swelling response, or subjective measures of focus, energy, and fatigue were observed.,The study found that neither Citrulline malate (CitMal) nor beetroot juice (BEET) supplementation enhanced performance during maximal isokinetic leg extension exercise, as all measured performance variables did not significantly differ with treatment (all p > 0.05).,Citrulline supplementation has a significant benefit compared to placebo in improving strength and power outcomes during high-intensity exercise involving multiple repetitive muscle actions of large muscle groups.,The abstract indicates that L-Citrulline supplementation significantly improved subjective feelings of concentration immediately after exercise. This suggests a positive impact on attention or mental focus as a result of the supplementation.,L-Citrulline supplementation significantly improved subjective feelings of muscle fatigue immediately after exercise, suggesting a beneficial effect on physical fatigue.,L-Citrulline supplementation significantly increased plasma L-arginine levels, reduced the cycling completion time by 1.5%, and improved subjective feelings of muscle fatigue and concentration immediately after exercise.,Citrulline supplementation led to significant decreases in serum levels of fasting blood sugar (FBS) and malondialdehyde (MDA). It also led to increased levels of total antioxidant capacity (TAC), citrulline, and nitrite/nitrate (NOx) when compared to the placebo group,In older female tennis players, taking Citrulline-malate (CM) before a match might help improve their grip strength and certain cycling performance aspects. However, it doesn't seem to affect their jumping power.,The supplementation led to an increase in ROS (Reactive Oxygen Species) production in polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) after exercise, followed by a decrease to levels lower than basal at recovery.

Chromium,,,,,,,,D,C-,D,D,C-,D,D,1," These findings suggest that Cr supplementation alone and combined of Cr together with vitamins C and E was effective for minimization of oxidative stress and improvement of glucose metabolism in type 2 DM patients.,The study found that chromium supplementation did not significantly improve glycogen synthesis during recovery from high-intensity exercise in overweight men. Both the chromium-supplemented group and the placebo group showed similar rates of glycogen synthesis after exercise (Chromium: 25.8 ± 8.0 mmol/kg/h and Placebo: 17.1 ± 4.7 mmol/kg/h). Additionally, there was no significant difference in elevations in glucose and insulin during recovery between the two groups. The study did observe a trend for lower phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) activity in the chromium group, but this did not lead to a statistically significant improvement in exercise performance or recovery. Therefore, based on this study, chromium supplementation cannot be considered beneficial for enhancing exercise performance in terms of glycogen synthesis during recovery.,The study found that taking chromium picolinate did not make the wrestlers' body composition or performance better than just training. However, those who only trained did improve their upper body endurance.,In older women, lifting weights makes muscles stronger, but taking extra chromium picolinate doesn’t make any difference to muscle strength, body fat, or muscle size.
G) Explain the results like I’m 5:,The results showed no change in muscle strength or body make-up, but the group taking the supplement did have more chromium coming out in their urine.,Taking chromium picolinate didn’t make the older men’s muscles bigger or stronger, even when they were lifting weights. However, lifting weights did help them gain muscle and strength, but this was not boosted by the supplement. The supplement only increased chromium in the urine.,Therefore, while Cr supplementation improved oxidative stress in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients with high HbA1C levels, it may not have the same effect in individuals with normal glycemic control.,The study found that blood markers of oxidative stress, such as glutathione peroxidase activity and levels of reduced glutathione, were essentially unchanged in the chromium (Cr)-enriched yeast group after 12 weeks.,Taking either zinc, chromium, or both as supplements helped reduce oxidative stress in Tunisian adults with type 2 diabetes, but it didn't significantly improve their blood sugar control.,This indicates that chromium picolinate at the dose used did not increase oxidative DNA damage, thus not worsening oxidative stress as measured by this specific marker.,No changes in levels of DNA damage, no effects on glucose and lipid metabolism.,The data confirm an ergogenic benefit of ingesting CHO during exercise designed to imitate sports like basketball, soccer, and hockey, but do not support the hypothesis that the addition of Cr would enhance this effect.,The study reports that serum indices of liver function remained within clinically normal,There was a significant reduction in plasma malondialdehyde (MDA) levels and a significant increase in plasma total antioxidant capacity (TAC) concentrations after taking chromium.,Taking chromium led to a significant reduction in serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP).,Prevalence of acne decreased following the administration of chromium supplements compared with the placebo.,he abstract mentions a reduction in hirsutism, which is excessive hair growth in areas where hair is normally minimal or absent.,Chromium picolinate (CP) showed a substantial antidepressant effect in the majority of patients.

However, one point to note is that the study does not directly measure muscle damage, but rather infers it through the LDH levels.,The study involved a Running-based Anaerobic Sprint Test (RAST), and the Cr-supplemented group showed better performance.,creatine supplementation failed to prevent the rise in oxidative stress markers. Moreover, there was no significant difference in antioxidant enzyme activity between the creatine-supplemented group and the placebo group.,Cr supplementation inhibited the increase of inflammation markers TNF-α and CRP., Average, maximum, and minimum power values were greater in the Cr-supplemented group compared with placebo,This research shows that taking creatine can help people perform better on mental and physical tasks and feel in a better mood when they're deprived of sleep for 24 hours,This research shows that taking creatine can help people perform better on mental and physical tasks and feel in a better mood when they're deprived of sleep for 24 hours,This research shows that taking creatine can help people perform better on mental and physical tasks and feel in a better mood when they're deprived of sleep for 24 hours,he dietary supplement of creatine significantly reduced mental fatigue in subjects performing repetitive mathematical calculations,The results showed no significant differences between the creatine group and the placebo group in terms of changes in plasma cortisol concentrations. The study specifically noted that both groups experienced lower cortisol levels after 24 hours of sleep deprivation.,The study reported that cortisol concentrations were significantly higher on Day 1 compared to Day 2. However, it did not indicate any significant differences in cortisol levels between the creatine supplementation group and the placebo group across the different testing periods.,The study concluded that creatine supplementation enhances memory performance in healthy individuals, with a particularly significant effect in older adults.,Creatine improves muscle power and strength. Combining betaine with creatine also shows improvement, but not more than creatine alone. ,The study found that acute creatine loading (25 g per day for 4 days) improved swimming performance significantly in elite swimmers when assessed by maximal interval sessions. The mean average interval swim times improved from 44.3±16.5 seconds before supplementation to 43.7±16.3 seconds after supplementation (P<0.01). However, after 2 months of longer-term creatine supplementation (5 g of creatine per day), there was no significant change in swimming performance compared to the placebo group. The results indicate that while short-term, high-dose creatine supplementation can enhance swimming performance, longer-term supplementation at a lower dose does not maintain these performance benefits.,In this study, 20 young competitive swimmers took creatine for four weeks and were tested on their swimming and swim bench performance. While their swimming speed didn’t change, they did better on the swim bench test after taking creatine.,Creatine supplementation did not alter muscle strength, muscle soreness, range of motion, or inflammation at each of the five follow-up times after exercise (<30 min, 24, 48, 72, and 96 hr; p > .05).,Creatine supplementation did not alter muscle strength, muscle soreness, range of motion, or inflammation at each of the five follow-up times after exercise (<30 min, 24, 48, 72, and 96 hr; p > .05).,Creatine supplementation did not alter muscle strength, muscle soreness, range of motion, or inflammation at each of the five follow-up times after exercise (<30 min, 24, 48, 72, and 96 hr; p > .05).,Creatine supplementation did not statistically improve muscle damage recovery. The only notable change was a reduction in creatine kinase activity at 48 hours post-exercise, with a standardized mean difference of -1.06 and a 95% confidence interval of [-1.97, -0.14], significant at p = .02. This indicates a potential effect on muscle damage markers but does not confirm overall improvement in muscle damage recovery.,The abstract confirms that creatine supplementation, regardless of dosing strategy, significantly augments lean tissue mass and strength gains from resistance training compared to placebo.,Creatine supplementation significantly increased measures of upper-body strength in older females. In studies lasting ≥ 24 weeks, both upper-body and lower-body strength were increased by Creatine, compared to placebo.,Creatine supplementation, when taken alongside resistance training, increased muscle strength by an average of 8% more than placebo during resistance training (20% vs 12%).

However, the study did not show any effects on lower intensity aerobic activities and did not directly measure mitochondrial function. Therefore, while there is some indication of improved mitochondrial function, the evidence is indirect and specific to certain types of exercise activities.,We concluded that creatine monohydrate increased the strength of high-intensity anaerobic and aerobic type activities in patients with mitochondrial cytopathies but had no apparent effects upon lower intensity aerobic activities.,While the study supports the use of creatine for improved sprint performance, it does not suggest any benefits for endurance-type exercise performance., While the study supports the use of creatine for improved sprint performance, it does not suggest any benefits for endurance-type exercise performance.,The study demonstrates that both short-term and long-term creatine supplementation improved performance during repeated supramaximal sprints on a cycle ergometer. This improvement in sprint performance aligns with the expected benefits of creatine supplementation in enhancing high-intensity exercise capacity. However, it's important to note that the study found no effect of creatine supplementation on whole-body and muscle oxidative capacity, substrate utilization, and time-trial performance during endurance cycling exercise. The increase in body mass observed following creatine loading, maintained after 6 weeks, was accounted for by a corresponding increase in fat-free mass. While the study supports the use of creatine for improved sprint performance, it does not suggest any benefits for endurance-type exercise performance.,Taking Creatine supplements helped swimmers perform better, swim consistently fast for longer, and feel less tiredness, compared to those who didn’t take the supplement.,These results suggest that creatine supplementation cannot be considered to be an ergogenic supplement ensuring improved performance and muscle mass gain in swimmers.,Swimmers in the placebo group showed higher lactate concentrations compared to those who received creatine supplementation.,The study found no significant differences in performance times between trials in highly trained swimmers after creatine supplementation. Despite the expected ergogenic effects of creatine, this particular study did not observe an improvement in sprint swimming performance as a result of the creatine supplementation regimen (5 g creatine monohydrate 4 times per day for 5 days). Therefore, based on this study, creatine supplementation cannot be considered a beneficial aid for improving exercise performance in the context of sprint swimming.,Taking creatine for a long time increases muscle creatine and helps perform better in short, intense cycling sprints, and increases body muscle mass. However, it does not improve muscle’s ability to use oxygen, change how the body uses energy, or improve long cycling performance.,When beta-alanine was combined with creatine, it helped some aspects of endurance in exercise, but when taken alone or not at all, there wasn’t a noticeable benefit in performance.,These findings suggest that short-term creatine supplementation does not enhance non-enzymatic antioxidant defence or protect against lipid peroxidation induced by exhaustive cycling in healthy males.,In elderly women, short-term oral creatine supplementation does not improve endurance capacity but increases the ability to perform lower-body functional living tasks involving rapid movements.,In elderly women, short-term oral creatine supplementation does not improve endurance capacity but increases the ability to perform lower-body functional living tasks involving rapid movements.,Endurance training increased muscle glycogen and improved endurance performance in both the groups. However, adding creatine to the mix didn't make a noticeable difference.,Taking creatine helped men improve their cycling efficiency and slightly increased their body weight. It didn’t change their heart structure, but it did make them use less oxygen during certain exercises.,Oral creatine supplementation at 2 g daily has no effect on muscle creatine concentration, muscle oxygen supply or muscle aerobic or anaerobic metabolism during endurance exercise.,There is also evidence that creatine improves functional performance in muscular dystrophy and idiopathic inflammatory myopathy.,High quality evidence from RCTs shows that short- and medium-term creatine treatment increases muscle strength in muscular dystrophies. ,Creatine supplementation effectively increased lower limb strength performance for exercises lasting less than 3 minutes.,Creatine supplementation is effective in upper limb strength performance for exercise with a duration of less than 3 min.,Taking creatine while doing resistance training helps older adults (57 to 70 years old) increase their muscle mass and strength in both chest and leg exercises.,Creatine supplementation does not improve aerobic or phosphagen metabolism performance in soccer players.,Creatine supplementation showed beneficial effects on anaerobic performance tests. Specifically, there was a large and significant effect on Wingate test performance.,However, these differences were not statistically significant (p > 0.05), leading to a neutral stance on the effect of CrM on inflammation based on the provided data.,CrM supplementation resulted in lower oxidative stress markers for the acute training response at both 24-36 h and 90 h post-exercise (SMD -1.37 and -1.36, respectively), although these differences were not statistically significant (p > 0.05).,Delayed-onset muscle soreness (DOMS) was also lower for the CrM group at 24 hours post-exercise as an acute training response.,Creatine monohydrate (CrM) supplementation reduced indirect muscle damage markers (i.e., creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, and/or myoglobin) at 48-90 hours post-exercise for the acute training response.,Creatine supplementation helps muscles grow better and recover faster during rehabilitative strength training after leg immobilization. This effect might be due to changes in certain muscle-related proteins.,Creatine supplementation helps muscles grow better and recover faster during rehabilitative strength training after leg immobilization. This effect might be due to changes in certain muscle-related proteins.,Taking creatine for a week helped men improve their sprint performance in hot conditions, increased their body mass and certain blood markers, but did not affect their heart rate, temperature, or sweat.,Taking creatine for a week helped men improve their sprint performance in hot conditions, increased their body mass and certain blood markers, but did not affect their heart rate, temperature, or sweat.,Creatine improves muscle power and strength.

However, the study did not show any effects on lower intensity aerobic activities and did not directly measure mitochondrial function. Therefore, while there is some indication of improved mitochondrial function, the evidence is indirect and specific to certain types of exercise activities.

This improvement in sprint performance aligns with the expected benefits of creatine supplementation in enhancing high-intensity exercise capacity. However, it's important to note that the study found no effect of creatine supplementation on whole-body and muscle oxidative capacity, substrate utilization, and time-trial performance during endurance cycling exercise. The increase in body mass observed following creatine loading, maintained after 6 weeks, was accounted for by a corresponding increase in fat-free mass. While the study supports the use of creatine for improved sprint performance, it does not suggest any benefits for endurance-type exercise performance.

Despite the expected ergogenic effects of creatine, this particular study did not observe an improvement in sprint swimming performance as a result of the creatine supplementation regimen (5 g creatine monohydrate 4 times per day for 5 days).

These supplements didn't work as well as usual ADHD medications, but they still made a difference and could be useful.,People taking supplements with a high amount (at least 60%) of a component called eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) saw a big improvement in their depression symptoms.,Supplements with less than 60% EPA of total EPA + DHA showed no significant impact on depression scores.,There was no significant benefit observed from 2g/d ethyl-eicosapentaenoate, and the 4g/d dosage showed non-significant trends towards improvement.,Omega-3 supplements can help people who are dealing with bipolar depression, but they do not seem to help those experiencing bipolar mania.,Omega-3 supplements can help people who are dealing with bipolar depression, but they do not seem to help those experiencing bipolar mania.,The authors conclude that there is insufficient high-quality evidence to determine the effects of n-3PUFAs as a treatment for MDD. While there is a suggestion of a small-to-modest effect compared to placebo, this finding is imprecise and likely biased towards a positive outcome for n-3PUFAs. Therefore, the actual benefit may be smaller than suggested.,In contrast, symptoms of depression were significantly reduced in 13 studies using supplements containing greater than 50% EPA and in 8 studies using pure ethyl-EPA.,Soccer players who took Omega-3 supplements for 4 weeks didn't run faster, jump higher, or show more strength than those who didn’t.

However, it significantly lowered IL-1β levels.,they managed to stabilize levels of the oxidative stress marker, Hydroxynonenal, and prevent an increase in reactive oxygen species, demonstrating anti-oxidative effects.,These fish oil components also caused a significant decrease in inflammatory markers, C-reactive protein and IL-6 levels. ,The inflammatory markers did not change in either group. It is likely that fish oil does not change hs-CRP or sTNF-Rs 1 or 2 in subjects without active inflammation., Neither the nutritional dose (0.85 g/day) nor the pharmaceutical dose (3.4 g/day) of EPA and DHA had any effects on cholesterol levels, endothelial function, or inflammatory markers. ,The intake of long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids significantly increased the proportion of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) in plasma phosphatidylcholine, cholesteryl esters, and triacylglycerols, and reduced the plasma soluble intercellular adhesion molecule (sICAM)-1 concentration, indicating a slight anti-inflammatory effect.,The study found that dietary supplementation with n-3 PUFA led to decreased TNF-alpha levels (a pro-inflammatory marker)., Despite previous theories, this study found that taking fish oil every day for 12 weeks did not reduce inflammation in healthy adults aged 50-70., The study found that n-3 supplementation decreased the lymphocyte, monocyte, TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β levels, which are markers of inflammation.,It also substantially lowered the production of inflammation-promoting substances (PGE2 and LTB4) by 60-75%., For patients with intermittent claudication (leg pain), adding Omega-3 from fish oil to their normal medicine routine (aspirin and statin) doesn't help in reducing inflammation or in improving blood flow., study found no significant effect of omega-3 fatty acids on oxidative stress.,he study found no significant effect of omega-3 fatty acids on serum systemic inflammation markers.,Fish oil supplementation significantly decreased CRP and IL-6 compared to SO, with a greater effect in the LFO than HFO groups. These markers are associated with inflammation, and their decrease suggests a reduction in inflammation.,EPA/DHA supplementation increases blood levels of these fatty acids and results in decreased resting levels of inflammatory biomarkers in exercise-trained men,The supplementation with EPA/DHA did not show significant effects on resting oxidative stress markers, and does not appear necessary for exercise-induced attenuation in either inflammation or oxidative stress.,With respect to oxidative stress, the study shows that neither FO nor ISO had a significant impact on malondialdehyde (MDA), a marker of oxidative stress.,The study also reveals no significant changes in inflammation markers (IL-6, TNFalpha) after supplementation with FO or ISO. T,The supplementation with either Fish Oil (1.8 g of omega-3 fatty acids daily) or Isoflavones (120 mg soy isolate daily) showed no significant benefits in reducing the physical parameters of Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness (DOMS), cortisol, creatine kinase, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor, malondialdehyde, or serum iron.,The supplementation with either Fish Oil (1.8 g of omega-3 fatty acids daily) or Isoflavones (120 mg soy isolate daily) showed no significant benefits in reducing the physical parameters of Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness (DOMS), cortisol, creatine kinase, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor, malondialdehyde, or serum iron.,: Omega-3 ingestion showed no statistically significant effect on the perceived pain, range of motion (ROM), and thigh circumference measurements taken before, immediately, and 24 hours after the exercise.,: Omega-3 ingestion showed no statistically significant effect on the perceived pain, range of motion (ROM), and thigh circumference measurements taken before, immediately, and 24 hours after the exercise.,he study investigates the effect of omega-3 ingestion on perceived pain and symptoms of delayed onset muscle soreness after eccentric exercise in knee extensors. ,Participants who were given n-3 LCPUFA supplements experienced significantly increased levels of oxidative stress, both at rest and after a judo-training session. , Additionally, in a small subsample, DHA supplementation resulted in fewer wake episodes and increased sleep duration per night.,DHA supplementation did not slow the rate of cognitive and functional decline in patients with Alzheimer's disease. ,Taking 900 mg of DHA each day for 24 weeks improved learning and memory in older adults who were showing signs of cognitive decline,Taking 900 mg of DHA each day for 24 weeks improved learning and memory in older adults who were showing signs of cognitive decline,In this study, older people at risk of worsening eye disease took certain nutritional supplements to see if these would improve their brain function.

L-Carnitine,,,,,,,,C+,B,A,A+,A,B-,C,8,"The study indicated that acetyl-L-carnitine (ALC) treatment resulted in improved cortisol rhythms and mean levels in elderly patients with major depression. This suggests that ALC was effective in normalizing the alterations in cortisol levels that are often associated with depression. Thus, ALC had a positive impact on regulating cortisol, which is a key stress hormone often disrupted in depressive disorders.,The abstract agrees that L-carnitine supplementation statistically improved indicators related to mitochondrial function. This conclusion is drawn from the significant changes observed in serum free and total carnitine at rest and after exercise (p < 0.001).,L-carnitine supplementation significantly improved maximal oxygen consumption (VO2) at rest, and serum total and free carnitine levels at rest and after exercise.,For people with COPD who are around 66 years old, adding L-carnitine to their workout program helps them exercise better, breathe stronger, and produce less lactate, compared to not having L-carnitine.,Taking L-carnitine increased some levels in the blood, but it did not make the college swimmers swim faster or affect other measured blood levels.,L-carnitine supplementation had no significant effect on muscle carnitine content and thus could not alter lactate accumulation during exercise.,The abstract suggests that L-carnitine improved mitochondrial function, as inferred from the increase in total carnitine levels in ischemic muscle biopsy and the reduced increase in popliteal venous lactate concentration after exercise (107 ± 16% before treatment vs. 54 ± 32% after carnitine, p < .01). These findings suggest enhanced mitochondrial efficiency in utilizing lactate, a byproduct of muscle metabolism, indicating improved mitochondrial function.,The abstract indicates that L-carnitine supplementation statistically improved exercise performance in patients with peripheral vascular disease. This is evidenced by a significant increase in the absolute walking distance on a treadmill test, rising from 174 ± 63 meters with placebo to 306 ± 122 meters with L-carnitine (p < .01).,This meta-analysis failed to confirm the previous findings regarding the effects of l-carnitine on hemoglobin, The study found that l-carnitine significantly decreased C-reactive protein (CRP), which is a marker of inflammation. ,Carnitine administration had no effect on various parameters related to exercise performance, such as the respiratory exchange ratio, muscle lactate accumulation, plasma lactate concentration, and muscle glycogen utilization.,It is concluded, that in contrast to other reports, carnitine supplementation may be of little benefit to exercise performance since the observed effects were small and inconsistent.,While the systematic review found that acetyl-L-carnitine reduces blood ammonium levels compared with placebo, which suggests a potential benefit for liver function, the overall quality of the evidence was rated as very low. The trials were at high risk of bias, underpowered, and the results were inconsistent. Therefore, it's uncertain whether acetyl-L-carnitine statistically improves liver function in patients with hepatic encephalopathy.,The study shows that supplementing with a substance called Acetyl-L-carnitine can help reduce symptoms of depression just as effectively as regular antidepressants, but with fewer side effects.,Intravenous L-carnitine significantly reduced total cholesterol, alanine aminotransferase, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, weight, waist circumference, waist hip ratio, insulin concentration, γ-glutamyltransferase concentration, perceived hunger, physical fatigue, and fatigue severity.,Intravenous L-carnitine significantly reduced total cholesterol, alanine aminotransferase, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, weight, waist circumference, waist hip ratio, insulin concentration, γ-glutamyltransferase concentration, perceived hunger, physical fatigue, and fatigue severity.,Carnitine supplementation resulted in a significant decrease in maximum and mean levels of left and right carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) and an increase in plasma nitric oxide (NO).,Carnitine supplementation did not show any significant effect on serum high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) levels.,GPLC supplementation combined with eight weeks of aerobic exercise decreases lipid peroxidation and elevates nitric oxide, but does not further improve blood lipid profiles in normolipidemic subjects.,GPLC supplementation combined with eight weeks of aerobic exercise decreases lipid peroxidation and elevates nitric oxide, but does not further improve blood lipid profiles in normolipidemic subjects.,The study reports a significant therapeutic effect of L-Carnitine (LC) on mental function in cirrhotic patients with hepatic encephalopathy (HE), as evidenced by improvements in the NCT-A, a psychometric test for assessing mental function.,The significant improvement in the NCT-A test results suggests that LC supplementation may have a beneficial effect on cognitive decline associated with HE in cirrhotic patients.,The study indicates a protective effect of LC in ammonia-precipitated encephalopathy in cirrhotic patients, which implies an improvement in liver function as HE is a complication of cirrhosis.,While the abstract suggests a tendency toward suppressed ammonia accumulation, which could be related to mitochondrial function, it does not conclusively state that LC supplementation improves mitochondrial function. The effect on ammonia production or removal may indicate a potential influence on metabolic stress or mitochondrial activity, but further investigation is needed.,Uncertain: While the study demonstrates that L-carnitine significantly reduced serum ammonia levels in patients with hepatic cirrhosis and subclinical hepatic encephalopathy (SHE), this is only one aspect of liver function. Ammonia levels are related to liver function, as the liver is responsible for detoxifying ammonia. However, without comprehensive data on other liver function parameters (such as bilirubin, albumin, liver enzymes, etc.), it is uncertain to conclude from this study alone that L-carnitine has a broader impact on overall liver function.,The study reports that treatment with L-carnitine for 4 weeks resulted in an overall improvement in psychometric test results compared with controls in patients with subclinical hepatic encephalopathy (SHE). This indicates a beneficial effect of L-carnitine on cognitive function in patients with hepatic cirrhosis and SHE.,Uncertain: While the study reports significant decreases in blood ammonia (NH₄⁺) levels in patients treated with acetyl-L-carnitine (ALC), which could suggest an improvement in a specific aspect of liver function, there is no direct assessment of overall liver function reported. Blood ammonia levels are related to liver function, as the liver is responsible for detoxifying ammonia. However, without additional liver function tests (such as bilirubin, albumin, liver enzymes, etc.), it is uncertain to conclusively determine the overall impact of ALC on liver function based on this study alone.,The study shows that patients with hepatic encephalopathy (HE) treated with acetyl-L-carnitine (ALC) exhibited significant improvements in physical activity and exercise performance. This is evidenced by better scores in the 7-day Physical Activity Recall questionnaire and the Short Physical Performance Battery in the HE1 group, as well as improvements in the 6-minute walk test in the HE2 group. These findings indicate that ALC supplementation had a positive impact on exercise performance in patients with mild and moderate hepatoencephalopathy.,Patients with HE treated with ALC showed a decrease in the severity of both mental and physical fatigue and an increase in physical activity. ,Patients with HE treated with ALC showed a decrease in the severity of both mental and physical fatigue and an increase in physical activity. ,We found that perioperative treatment with l-carnitine was significantly better than ordinary treatment in reducing postoperative serum ammonia levels, suggesting that l-carnitine may serve as a pivotal regulator of liver injury and repair and result in shorter postoperative hospitalization (,The marked improvements in various psychometric tests for cognitive functions in the ALC group compared to the placebo group suggest that ALC treatment is effective in reducing cognitive decline in patients with severe hepatic encephalopathy. This is further supported by the significant improvement in EEG results in the ALC group.,The study showed a significant reduction in alanine transaminase (ALT) levels in both ALC and placebo groups, with a greater reduction in the placebo group. While there is a reduction in ALT levels indicating an effect on a liver enzyme, the comparison between the two groups does not clearly favor ALC over placebo in this specific aspect.,The study demonstrates significant improvements in various cognitive function tests (Everyday Memory Questionnaire, Logical Memory test, Trail Making Test A and B, Controlled Oral Word Association Test, Hooper test, Judgement of line orientation, Digit Cancellation time) in patients with severe hepatic encephalopathy treated with ALC (acetyl-L-carnitine). These findings strongly suggest that ALC has a beneficial effect on cognitive functions in these patients.,In summary, the abstract supports the conclusion that L-carnitine supplementation may have a beneficial effect on cognitive decline in patients with OHE, as evidenced by improved GCS scores.,The study reports that patients with overt hepatic encephalopathy (OHE) treated with L-carnitine showed a significant improvement in the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), indicating enhanced cognitive function. The greater improvement in GCS scores in the group receiving L-carnitine compared to the group not receiving it suggests that L-carnitine supplementation had a positive impact on cognition in these patients.,The study found significant improvements in cognitive function in patients treated with acetyl-L-carnitine (ALC). This was evidenced by improvements in various cognitive tests including the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT), Trail Making Test-A and B, and the Auditory Verbal Learning Test (AVL). These results indicate that ALC had a positive effect on cognitive functions in patients with minimal hepatic encephalopathy (MHE),The study reports a significant decrease in AST (aspartate aminotransferase) levels in the group treated with ALC. AST is a liver enzyme, and its reduction suggests a beneficial effect of acetyl-L-carnitine on liver enzymes in patients with MHE.,In conclusion, acute administration of L-carnitine did not affect the metabolism or improve the physical performance of the endurance-trained athletes during the run and did not alter their recovery.,Carnitine helps athletes ride bikes for a longer time, and adding caffeine makes this effect even stronger. Caffeine alone doesn’t make much of a difference. This might be because carnitine helps use fat for energy, which is good for endurance., In conclusion, 2 g of L-carnitine taken 2 h before a first of two constant-load exercise tests had no influence on the second tests performed 3 h after the first test compared with placebo.,Taking propionyl-L-carnitine for 4 weeks helped improve muscle strength in patients with peripheral arterial disease, but it didn't improve their calf endurance.,Similarly, the abstract suggests that L-carnitine supplementation did not statistically improve inflammation markers in the study's demographic. Measurements of interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, and C-reactive protein showed no significant changes due to the supplementation.,No substantial changes in skeletal muscle strength, body composition, or circulating markers (like interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, C-reactive protein, and IGF-1).,The abstract indicates that L-carnitine supplementation statistically improved symptoms associated with impaired mitochondrial function in patients with mitochondrial myopathy (MM),For people with mitochondrial myopathy and eye movement issues, taking L-carnitine for 2 months made them exercise longer and breathe in more oxygen during intense workouts.,These results suggest that up to 3 g/d GPLC for 8 wk in conjunction with aerobic-exercise training is ineffective for increasing muscle carnitine content and has no significant effects on aerobic- or anaerobic-exercise performance.,. In conclusion, GPLC appears to be a useful dietary supplement to enhance anaerobic work capacity and potentially sport performance, but apparently the dosage must be determined specific to the intensity and duration of exercise.,Taking L-carnitine made the young men perform better in exercise, as they could use oxygen more efficiently and had better power output.,The study demonstrates that oral administration of L-carnitine significantly improved markers of oxidative stress in patients with type 2 diabetes. This is evidenced by significant reductions in oxidized LDL levels, thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances, and conjugated dienes in the L-carnitine-treated group compared with the placebo group.,Taking l-Carnitine supplements for 12 weeks significantly improved heart health markers related to inflammation and oxidative stress in people with coronary artery disease.,Taking l-Carnitine supplements for 12 weeks significantly improved heart health markers related to inflammation and oxidative stress in people with coronary artery disease.,The study aims to investigate the effect of l-carnitine supplementation in women with knee osteoarthritis (OA), a condition often associated with inflammation.

Serum MDA-TBARS (Malondialdehyde - Thiobarbituric Acid-Reactive Substance), a marker of lipid peroxidation, was significantly lower 24h after exercise in the L-carnitine group compared with the placebo group.,Taking a supplement called L-carnitine L-tartrate (LCLT) helped reduce muscle damage caused by exercise in men who weight train recreationally. I, The study mentions that LCLT supplementation affects markers of postexercise metabolic stress, which could potentially include inflammation. However, the abstract does not explicitly mention inflammation, so this categorization is uncertain.,Taking 1 or 2 grams of L-carnitine L-tartrate, a dietary supplement, every day for three weeks can help to reduce muscle soreness and stress after resistance exercise in healthy young men. , The study mentions that LCLT supplementation beneficially affects markers of muscle damage.,The study examines the effects of L-carnitine on pain induced by eccentric muscle effort.

These markers are associated with muscle damage, indicating that LCLT may reduce muscle damage caused by high-repetition squat exercise. The amount of muscle disruption from MRI scans during LCLT was 41-45% of the placebo area. These data indicate that LCLT supplementation is effective in assisting recovery from high-repetition squat exercise.,The indicators of muscle tissue disruption and markers associated with muscle damage were notably reduced with LCLT supplementation. So, it seems like LCLT could indeed be beneficial for reducing muscle soreness following intense exercise.,The study found that exercise-induced increases in plasma malondialdehyde, a marker of oxidative stress, returned to resting values sooner during LCLT supplementation compared with placebo. This suggests that LCLT may help reduce oxidative stress caused by high-repetition squat exercise.,The abstract mentions that plasma malondealdehyde, a marker of muscle damage, was reduced during the LCLT trial. This suggests that L-carnitine L-tartrate (LCLT) supplementation might indeed help in reducing muscle damage.,This suggests that LCLT may have an effect on oxidative stress, as malondealdehyde is a marker of oxidative stress and its reduction indicates a decrease in oxidative damage.

This was evidenced by improvements in various cognitive tests including the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT), Trail Making Test-A and B, and the Auditory Verbal Learning Test (AVL).

There weren't notable differences for grip strength, pull-ups, steps, or cycling.,. There weren't notable differences for grip strength, pull-ups, steps, or cycling.,Tyrosine supplementation did not prevent a decrease in physical performance, in this case, measured by a step test, when subjects were subjected to cold temperatures., The study found that performance on a Match-to-Sample task, which likely requires attention, decreased 18% on the placebo trial compared to the control, but there was no difference between the tyrosine trial and the control. This suggests that tyrosine supplementation may help maintain attention during cold exposure.,The study found that dietary tyrosine supplementation is effective for mitigating cold-induced decreases in cognitive performance such as working memory, even with reduced core temperature.,This study shows that eating an energy bar with a special ingredient called tyrosine can help you think better and aim better, even when you're really cold. ,When healthy men took tyrosine with their meals, it significantly reduced a type of hormone called plasma norepinephrine in their blood. ,The study suggests that dietary tyrosine supplementation in man causes an increase in brain catecholaminergic activity. Dopamine is a type of catecholamine, and it is often associated with mood regulation.,Oral ingestion of tyrosine significantly increased plasma concentrations of norepinephrine, dopamine, and epinephrine, and reduced plasma levels of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid.,Oral ingestion of tyrosine significantly increased plasma concentrations of norepinephrine, dopamine, and epinephrine, and reduced plasma levels of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid., Significant decrease in adrenaline concentration in the Tyrosine group following a 2-week intervention.,o noticeable change in peak power, power drop, or mean power of anaerobic sports capacity in both Tyrosine and Placebo groups.,Tyrosine had no significant influence on any other cognitive measures or on physical performance.,This suggests that increasing the availability of TYR may improve cognitive function during exposure to exercise-heat stress., The study investigates the effects of tyrosine supplementation on cognitive-control function, specifically the ability to stop overt responses. The results indicate that tyrosine supplementation improves this aspect of cognition.,There was no evidence found in the study that L-tyrosine had any antidepressant activity.,Tyrosine was found to improve the performance on two cognitive tasks, which were performed 1 h after administration of the medication and which could be characterized as highly sensitive to stress.,Tyrosine had no discernible effects on mood, systolic blood pressure, and heart rate.,Tyrosine was found to improve the performance on two cognitive tasks, which were performed 1 h after administration of the medication and which could be characterized as highly sensitive to stress.,Tyrosine was found to improve the performance on two cognitive tasks, which were performed 1 h after administration of the medication and which could be characterized as highly sensitive to stress.,L-tyrosine had a minor stimulating effect on the central nervous system of subjects with narcolepsy and cataplexy, making them feel less tired, less drowsy, and more alert, but this effect is not clinically significant in the treatment of the narcoleptic syndrome., No significant improvement was observed in daytime drowsiness, cataplexy, sleep paralysis, night-time sleep, overall clinical response, and measurements of multiple sleep latency and tests of speed and attention., No significant improvement was observed in daytime drowsiness, cataplexy, sleep paralysis, night-time sleep, overall clinical response, and measurements of multiple sleep latency and tests of speed and attention., No significant improvement was observed in daytime drowsiness, cataplexy, sleep paralysis, night-time sleep, overall clinical response, and measurements of multiple sleep latency and tests of speed and attention.,In this study, giving people tyrosine before placing them in a stressful condition increased their heart rate and improved their attention. ,In this study, giving people tyrosine before placing them in a stressful condition increased their heart rate and improved their attention. ,The study reports that tyrosine significantly decreased adverse moods in subjects who exhibited average or greater responses to the stressful environmental conditions.  The study suggests that tyrosine may help protect against the adverse consequences of stress, which could potentially include a decrease in motivation., The study investigates the effects of acutely stressful situations, specifically a 4.5 hour exposure to cold and hypoxia.,muscle strength and endurance (handgrip) was not significantly improved by tyrosine ingestion. , Total power for stair stepping (tyrosine 223 +/- 8 watts, placebo 216 +/- 9 watts) was not significantly improved by tyrosine ingestion. ,The total time on the treadmill was not significantly lengthened with ingestion of tyrosine (118.9 +/- 1.4 min) as compared with placebo (119.2 +/- 1.2 min).,Tyrosine did not alter most subjective or physiological responses to severe acute stress, but it increased ratings of anger.

The increase in venous O2 partial pressure was higher in the Mg-orotate group (208%) compared to the control group (126%), suggesting enhanced oxygen utilization which can be linked to oxidative processes. However, without direct measures of oxidative stress markers, such as reactive oxygen species or antioxidant levels, a definitive conclusion cannot be drawn.

This inference is based on the lesser increase in creatine kinase (CK) catalytic concentration after the test in the Mg-orotate group (122% increase) compared to the control group (140% increase). CK is often used as an indicator of muscle damage, so a lower increase implies less muscle damage.

Panax Gingseng,,,,,,,,F,C,D,F,C,D,D,2,"In young adults, taking Ginkgo biloba, Panax ginseng, or a combo of both can boost memory, help with certain attention tasks, and make people feel better in terms of mood.,In young adults, taking Ginkgo biloba, Panax ginseng, or a combo of both can boost memory, help with certain attention tasks, and make people feel better in terms of mood.,In young adults, taking Ginkgo biloba, Panax ginseng, or a combo of both can boost memory, help with certain attention tasks, and make people feel better in terms of mood.,The study found that both men and women increased their muscular strength after eight weeks of weight training, but taking ginseng didn't make any difference compared to not taking it., The present data in healthy adult females indicate that chronic dietary supplementation with a standardized extract of Panax Ginseng C.A. Meyer does not result in an enhancement of work performance or a change in energy metabolism and improvement of the recovery response from maximal physical work.,The study found that ginseng administration at the prescribed dose exhibited training-like effects on VO2 max, anaerobic power (AP), and leg muscle strength. Specifically, VO2 max increased significantly in the ginseng-untrained (GU) group, and improvements in anaerobic power and leg muscle strength were observed across various groups, including those receiving ginseng. However, no clear synergistic action was observed when combining ginseng administration with exercise training. This indicates that ginseng alone did have a positive impact on certain aspects of exercise performance.,Panax ginseng supplementation showed no significant impact on peak aerobic exercise performance, including VO2, exercise time, workload, plasma lactate, and hematocrit at peak levels, or for heart rate and rate of perceived exertion at various watt levels.,The abstract states that neither ginseng nor placebo influenced maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) and lactate threshold (LAT), which are key indicators of exercise capacity. Therefore, ginseng treatment did not statistically improve exercise performance as measured by these parameters.,- Ginseng treatment was found to improve psychomotor performance during exercise, as evidenced by the shortening of multiple choice reaction time (RT) at rest and during exercise.,Ginseng supplementation has no significant effects on cortisol (C) levels (P = 0.059) in male bodybuilders. Cortisol is a hormone that is often associated with stress.,There was no statistically significant improvement from baseline Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE) in the Korean red ginseng treatment groups compared to the control group.,Korean red ginseng did not significantly alter salivary cortisol or dehydroepiandrosterone levels.,HRG80 treatment was significantly superior compared to that with the PGS and placebo regarding perceived-stress (PS) scores after single and repeated administrations for 5 and 12 days, The study mentions a significant interaction effect in memory tests, indicating that HRG80 treatment was more beneficial than that with a placebo.,HRG80 treatment was more beneficial than that with a placebo, and significantly superior compared to that with the PGS and placebo regarding attention scores after single and repeated administrations for 5 and 12 days., Ginseng significantly improved fatigue in cancer patients.,- Ginseng treatment was found to improve psychomotor performance during exercise, as evidenced by the shortening of multiple choice reaction time (RT) at rest and during exercise., In conclusion, our findings indicate that P. ginseng was shown to have antioxidant property. It enhanced the antioxidant defense mechanism in healthy populations and the results may reinforce the use of P. ginseng as a potential antioxidant supplement., KRG supplementation may attenuate lymphocyte DNA damage and LDL oxidation by upregulating antioxidant enzyme activity.,Taking Korean red ginseng for 8 weeks significantly improves the body's ability to fight off harmful molecules and reduces damage to DNA and bad cholesterol levels in people aged 20 to 65., but it does have a decreasing effect on T levels response to acute resistance exercise.,Ginseng supplementation has no significant effects on cortisol (C) levels (P = 0.059) in male bodybuilders. Cortisol is a hormone that is often associated with stress., Ginseng supplementation has no significant effects on muscle strength (bench press P = 0.684, leg press P = 0.717) in male bodybuilders.,Our data in healthy men do not offer support for claims that P ginseng C.A. Meyer is an ergogenic aid to improve submaximal and maximal aerobic exercise performance., We conclude that acute supplementation of 200 mg of PG did not affect the endurance running performance of the heat-adapted male recreational runners in the heat.,There were no statistically significant positive benefits of ginseng ingestion on the physiological responses to intense exercise.,The study mentions a reduction in the risk of exercise injury, which could potentially be linked to muscle damage. ,GS supplementation led to reduced fatigue associated with eccentric movement.,Jilin ginseng root (GS) supplementation resulted in increased serum levels of free fatty acids and glucose, greater maximum oxygen consumption (VO2 max), and improved drop jump performance, characterized by increased jump height and reactive strength index.,Jilin ginseng root (GS) supplementation resulted in increased serum levels of free fatty acids and glucose, greater maximum oxygen consumption (VO2 max), and improved drop jump performance, characterized by increased jump height and reactive strength index.,Interestingly, while Ginkgo Biloba seemed to lower heart rate and blood pressure responses to these tasks in women, Ginseng actually increased these responses., But when you take both Ginkgo and Ginseng together, you can do a lot of hard problems, and you can do both types of problems very well if you take a bit more of them.,The intake of Korean red ginseng extract resulted in significantly reduced exercise-induced muscle damage and inflammatory responses, and enhanced insulin sensitivity.,The intake of Korean red ginseng extract resulted in significantly reduced exercise-induced muscle damage and inflammatory responses, and enhanced insulin sensitivity., But it didn't make a noticeable difference to muscle damage or soreness after the workout., But it didn't make a noticeable difference to muscle damage or soreness after the workout.,Taking Panax Ginseng helped athletes use their muscles more effectively and feel less effort during a hard leg workout. It also helped them recover their strength quicker. ,In terms of sleep, the study shows that FG may have a potential benefit in improving the first-night effect (FNE), a phenomenon where sleep quality is disrupted during the first night in a new environment.,Our results suggest the administration of FG could improve the FNE in humans. The improvement may be related to an anxiolytic effect of FG which acts via GABAergic modification.,High-dose Korean red ginseng (KRG) group exhibited substantial improvement in Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS) and Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR).,High-dose Korean red ginseng (KRG) group exhibited substantial improvement in Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS) and Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR).,The study shows that Alzheimer's disease patients, who took Korean white ginseng powder every day for three months, showed better mental function compared to those who didn't take ginseng.,and also performed better on cognitive tasks related to attention, memory, and decision-making compared to those who took a placebo.,and also performed better on cognitive tasks related to attention, memory, and decision-making compared to those who took a placebo.,The study found that both ginseng and glucose can independently improve mental math performance and lessen feelings of mental fatigue during tough mental tasks. ,The study found that both ginseng and glucose can independently improve mental math performance and lessen feelings of mental fatigue during tough mental tasks. ,The study shows that Alzheimer's disease patients, who took Korean white ginseng powder every day for three months, showed better mental function compared to those who didn't take ginseng.,The administration of Panax Ginseng showed no observable effects on cognition.,The study found that Panax ginseng improved the cognitive performance of Alzheimer's disease patients. This was measured using the mini-mental state examination (MMSE) and Alzheimer disease assessment scale (ADAS), which showed improvements after ginseng treatment. ,The study found that Panax ginseng improved the cognitive performance of Alzheimer's disease patients.

Spirulina,,,,,,,,D,F,D,D,A-,C-,D,-1,"Taking Spirulina helped cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy by improving their immune system and reducing the bad effects on their blood cells. However, it did not affect their levels of hemoglobin and platelets.,The study indicates that Spirulina maxima supplementation, both with and without a systematic exercise program, resulted in improved cardiorespiratory fitness (evidenced by increased maximal oxygen uptake) and weight loss. These factors are indicative of enhanced exercise performance. Additionally, the time to reach fatigue and the onset of blood lactate accumulation were improved in the Spirulina-supplemented groups, further supporting an improvement in exercise performance.,Spirulina supplementation significantly increased hemoglobin levels, reduced oxygen uptake and heart rate during submaximal arm cycling exercise, and allowed for an increased oxygen uptake at the time of fatigue.,The study suggests that spirulina supplementation may modulate immune responses associated with strenuous exercise. Specifically, the absence of a post-exercise increase in Treg count and a post-recovery decrease in Tδγ cell count in the supplemented group, compared to the placebo group, indicates a potential anti-inflammatory effect of spirulina.,Taking spirulina extract for 6 weeks seems to help rowers maintain better immune function after intense rowing exercises, compared to those who didn’t take spirulina.,We only observed a non-significant small advantage in vertical jump and sprint performance in the SPI group. Based on the data from this study, Spirulina supplementation has modest effects in elite rugby players during the competitive phase. ,The meta-analysis showed a marginal decrease in thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) levels, which suggests a potential improvement in oxidative stress. However, there was no significant effect on malondialdehyde (MDA) concentrations, another marker of oxidative stress. Therefore, the results are mixed regarding the impact of spirulina on oxidative stress.,The results indicated no significant effect of spirulina on tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), a key inflammatory marker. While there was a marginal decrease in interleukin-6 (IL-6) and an initial increase in interleukin-2 (IL-2) concentrations, the latter became insignificant after sensitivity analysis. Overall, the evidence does not strongly support a statistically significant improvement in inflammation markers with spirulina supplementation.,The study found a significant reduction in interleukin-6 (IL-6) concentration (p = 0.002) in patients supplemented with Spirulina, suggesting a decrease in inflammation.,The study reports a significant improvement in total antioxidant status (TAS; p = 0.001) in the Spirulina group compared to the placebo group, indicating a beneficial effect on oxidative stress in obese patients with treated hypertension.,In the non-obese group, spirulina supplementation showed a significant increase in interleukin (IL)-2 concentration and a significant increment in IL-2/IL-6 ratio.,In the non-obese group, spirulina supplementation showed a significant increase in total antioxidant status level and a significant decrease in thiobarbituric acid reactive substances level.,The decrease in IL-6 suggests a reduction in inflammation, indicating that spirulina statistically benefited inflammation markers in these subjects.,The results demonstrate that spirulina has favorable effects on lipid profiles, immune variables, and antioxidant capacity in healthy, elderly male and female subjects and is suitable as a functional food.,Spirulina supplementation did not significantly alter the blood concentration of MDA or significantly change plasma total antioxidant status, although there was a trend toward higher values.,Wheat grass, when taken as a supplement, has shown to improve antioxidant levels in the body, while Spirulina didn't show significant improvements in the same.,These changes suggest an improvement in oxidative stress markers, as glutathione peroxidase is an important antioxidant enzyme, and oxidized glutathione is a marker of oxidative stress. T,The abstract states that Spirulina platensis treatment significantly increased blood concentrations of superoxide dismutase (SOD), a marker of oxidative stress reduction, in obese individuals (P < 0.05). This suggests that the supplement statistically improved oxidative stress biomarkers.,The higher dose of 2.3 g/day in this study was associated with significant reduction of chronic pain at rest and when physically active.,Taking a high dose of aqueous cyanophyta extract (ACE) daily for two weeks safely improved liver function and significantly reduced chronic pain, but did not affect blood clotting or platelet activation.,The study measures the concentrations of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), which are liver enzymes.

Tart Cherry Juice,,,,,,,,F,C,F,F,C+,C,C+,2,"The present study suggests that the ability of tart cherry juice to reduce systolic BP and LDL cholesterol, in part, may be due to its anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory properties.,The study observed a reduction in the mean c-reactive protein (CRP) level after the 12-week intervention with tart cherry juice compared to the control group. CRP is a well-known biomarker of inflammation, and a reduction in its levels is indicative of decreased inflammation in the body.,The study found that tart cherry juice significantly increased the plasma levels of DNA repair activity of 8-oxoguanine glycosylase. This suggests that the consumption of tart cherry juice may have a role in repairing DNA damage, as the increased activity of 8-oxoguanine glycosylase is associated with the repair of damaged DNA.,We conclude that a tart cherry juice concentrate rich in anthocyanins has no effect on arterial stiffness, c-reactive protein and risk markers for cardiovascular disease, but evokes a minor increase in antioxidant status in healthy adults.,We conclude that a tart cherry juice concentrate rich in anthocyanins has no effect on arterial stiffness, c-reactive protein and risk markers for cardiovascular disease, but evokes a minor increase in antioxidant status in healthy adults.,This suggests that Montmorency tart cherry consumption, both alone and in combination with exercise, statistically improved oxidative stress markers following a high-fat meal.,The study reports a reduction in total antioxidant status (TAS) (P = 0.036) from mid- to post-supplementation with MTCJ. Since TAS is a measure of the body's antioxidant capacity, a reduction in TAS implies a decrease in the body's ability to counteract oxidative stress, not an improvement.,The reduction in oxidized LDL in the Tart Cherry group (P = .047) can also be interpreted as an indication of reduced oxidative stress, since oxidized LDL is a marker of lipid peroxidation, a process driven by oxidative stress. However, similar to the inflammation markers, the levels were not significantly lower than the baseline values. Therefore, while there is evidence of some benefit in reducing oxidative stress compared to the Control, the effect is not strong enough to be considered a definitive improvement from the initial state.,he study found that oxidized low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1) were significantly lower in the Tart Cherry group compared to the Control group at 12 weeks (P = .047 and P = .036, respectively). These markers are associated with inflammation, particularly in the context of cardiovascular health. However, it's important to note that these markers were not significantly lower than their baseline values, indicating a relative improvement compared to the Control but not an absolute reduction from the starting levels.,There was no significant change over time in plasma oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) or between groups in ORAC.,Despite the observed average 8% decrease in uric acid (UA), the abstract does not provide evidence that this change in UA levels correlates with a statistically significant improvement in inflammation markers, specifically high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP). hsCRP is a more direct and commonly used marker for inflammation, and the study reports no significant change in hsCRP levels (p = 0.64).,Drinking Montmorency tart cherry juice before cycling helped trained cyclists produce more power and do more work during a short sprint, and also lowered their blood pressure. However, it did not change how long they could cycle intensely, nor did it affect certain other blood and health markers.,Short-term MCC ingestion does not affect the anabolic response to protein and exercise.,Drinking montmorency cherry concentrate reduced some muscle inflammation in older men after exercise,,Tart cherry concentrate effectively reduced pain in nonmetastatic breast cancer patients suffering from joint pain due to their cancer medication, ,The consumption of tart cherry juice did not provide a statistically significant benefit in attenuating muscle soreness or improving wellness scores compared to the control group after the rugby union match.,Drinking tart cherry juice for a short period improved sleep for elite female hockey players, but it didn't affect their levels of melatonin or cortisol.,esults suggest that MCJ consumption does not decrease pain following a high-intensity resistance exercise protocol.,the results suggest that MCJ consumption does not decrease inflammation as indicated by IL-6 levels and monocyte subset responses following a high-intensity resistance exercise protocol.,Drinking Montmorency Cherry Juice for a week before high-intensity exercise didn't make a difference in muscle soreness or certain immune responses in a group of trained young men.,The study measures delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) as one of the markers of EIMD. The exercise protocol induced significant increases in DOMS, but there were no statistically significant differences between treatment groups.,Consumption of tart cherry juice and pomegranate juice did not show a statistically significant difference in recovery from exercise-induced muscle damage compared to a placebo.,MCC supplementation upregulated antioxidant gene and protein expression, indicating potential mitigation of oxidative stress.,The study shows MCC supplementation conserved isometric muscle strength, suggesting potential reduction in muscle damage., Consuming a supplement made from Montmorency cherries helped people recover their muscle strength faster after strenuous exercise, ,Drinking tart cherry juice before and after a soccer game did not help professional male soccer players recover faster or feel less muscle soreness than those who had a cherry-flavored control drink.,Drinking tart cherry juice before and after a soccer game did not help professional male soccer players recover faster or feel less muscle soreness than those who had a cherry-flavored control drink.,The study investigated inflammation in trained cyclists using MC and found that the IL-6 and hsCRP responses to trials were lower in the MC group versus the placebo group, indicating an attenuated inflammatory response.,The study examined oxidative stress in trained cyclists using Montmorency tart cherry concentrate (MC) and found that the LOOH responses to trials were lower in the MC group versus the placebo group.,The study found that drinking tart cherry juice twice a day for eight days helps team sports players recover faster from exercises like jumping, sprinting, and maximal muscle contraction, but it doesn't change inflammation or muscle damage markers.,The study found that drinking tart cherry juice twice a day for eight days helps team sports players recover faster from exercises like jumping, sprinting, and maximal muscle contraction, but it doesn't change inflammation or muscle damage markers.,The study found that drinking tart cherry juice twice a day for eight days helps team sports players recover faster from exercises like jumping, sprinting, and maximal muscle contraction, but it doesn't change inflammation or muscle damage markers.,Tart cherry juice (TCJ) significantly improved recovery time for countermovement jump, 20-meter sprint, and maximal voluntary isometric contraction at 24 and 48 hours after the Loughborough Intermittent Shuttle Test.,Despite the positive benefits, cherry juice consumption didn't affect the exercise-induced increase in creatine kinase activity.,The results show that the increase in protein carbonyls (PC), a marker of oxidative stress, was lower in the cherry juice trials than in the fruit concentrate trials. This indicates that the cherry juice may have had a positive effect on reducing oxidative stress.,The study investigates the effects of Montmorency cherry juice on muscle function after intensive unilateral leg exercise. The results show that the recovery of isometric muscle strength was significantly faster after consumption of the cherry juice. This indicates that the cherry juice may have had a positive effect on muscle damage recovery.,The consumption of Montmorency cherry juice significantly accelerated recovery of muscle strength after intensive unilateral leg exercise. It also lowered both the percentage and absolute increase in protein carbonyls, indicating an attenuation of oxidative damage from the exercise., However, it didn't change other blood markers linked with inflammation, oxidative stress, or muscle damage., However, it didn't change other blood markers linked with inflammation, oxidative stress, or muscle damage., However, it didn't change other blood markers linked with inflammation, oxidative stress, or muscle damage.,The results of the study suggest that Montmorency cherry concentrate can be an efficacious functional food for accelerating recovery and reducing exercise-induced inflammation following strenuous cycling exercise.,Montmorency cherry concentrate helped trained cyclists perform better and recover faster by decreasing muscle decline and improving cycling efficiency, as well as reducing inflammation after a demanding cycling test. ,Montmorency cherry concentrate helped trained cyclists perform better and recover faster by decreasing muscle decline and improving cycling efficiency, as well as reducing inflammation after a demanding cycling test. ,Montmorency cherry concentrate helped trained cyclists perform better and recover faster by decreasing muscle decline and improving cycling efficiency, as well as reducing inflammation after a demanding cycling test. ,However, it didn't make a significant change in their body's inflammation levels.,The study measures pain pressure threshold (PPT) as part of the recovery indicators.

CRP is a well-known biomarker of inflammation, and a reduction in its levels is indicative of decreased inflammation in the body.

Since TAS is a measure of the body's antioxidant capacity, a reduction in TAS implies a decrease in the body's ability to counteract oxidative stress, not an improvement.

However, similar to the inflammation markers, the levels were not significantly lower than the baseline values. Therefore, while there is evidence of some benefit in reducing oxidative stress compared to the Control, the effect is not strong enough to be considered a definitive improvement from the initial state.

These markers are associated with inflammation, particularly in the context of cardiovascular health. However, it's important to note that these markers were not significantly lower than their baseline values, indicating a relative improvement compared to the Control but not an absolute reduction from the starting levels.

Theanine,,,,,,,,D,C-,D,D,D,D,B-,1,"Taking L-theanine while undergoing intensive rowing training helps to reduce IL-10, which is an indicator of better immune balance, but it also reduces some immune cells and changes the ratio of others.,The abstract shows that L-theanine supplementation led to significant changes in immune response markers post-exercise, like a decrease in interleukin 10 (IL-10) concentration and changes in the ratios of IL-2 to IL-10 and IFN-γ to IL-10. These findings suggest an effect on inflammation, indicating that the supplement may have a beneficial impact on inflammation in athletes.,The study found that variability of serum BDNF levels accounted for 26.2% of the total variance in reduction of dysphoric mood. The changes in cortisol-to-DHEAS*100 molar ratio accounted for 30% to 34% of the variance in dysphoric mood scores., The study found that variability of serum BDNF levels accounted for 38.2% in anxiety scores. The changes in cortisol-to-DHEAS*100 molar ratio accounted for 15.9% in anxiety scores.,Theanine, one of the substances studied, was found to slow overall reaction time on a cognitive task.,While theanine was tested, no significant effect on anxiety was noted.,However, theanine didn't really affect mood and it made reaction times slower on a certain task., Caffeine was found to raise alertness, jitteriness, and blood pressure, while theanine helped to lower the caffeine-induced rise in blood pressure. ,The study also suggests that LGNC-07 may enhance attention.,This study showed that a daily dose of LGNC-07, a combination of green tea extract and l-theanine, over 16 weeks improved memory and attention in people with mild cognitive impairment. ,This study showed that a daily dose of LGNC-07, a combination of green tea extract and l-theanine, over 16 weeks improved memory and attention in people with mild cognitive impairment. ,theanine enhances local processing of visual attention, Caffeine makes you more stressed, while theanine reduces stress.,There was no significant change observed in sleep latency and other sleep parameters. ,The study showed that consumption of L-theanine significantly improved sleep quality in boys diagnosed with ADHD, as measured by increased sleep percentage and sleep efficiency scores., The results of this study suggest that L-theanine containing tablets promote the release of alpha waves related to mental relaxation and concentration in young adult males., In those with low anxiety, there were no significant changes in frontal or occipital alpha power values after taking L-theanine., In those with low anxiety, there were no significant changes in frontal or occipital alpha power values after taking L-theanine., The researchers found that the tablets helped the participants with high anxiety to relax and focus better, but didn't make a difference for those with low anxiety.,The combined intake of caffeine and L-theanine did not confer additional benefits over each compound taken alone.,The combined intake of caffeine and L-theanine did not confer additional benefits over each compound taken alone., The ingestion of caffeine and L-theanine individually reduced error rates in tasks requiring sustained attention, Drinking caffeine or L-theanine found in tea helped people make fewer mistakes when doing monotonous tasks over a long time. ,L-theanine didn't show any effect on its own, and when combined with caffeine, it canceled out the benefits of caffeine.,L-theanine didn't show any effect on its own, and when combined with caffeine, it canceled out the benefits of caffeine.,Drinking tea with both L-theanine and caffeine helps people pay attention better and make clearer distinctions between different things. However, L-theanine alone doesn't seem to make any difference.,The findings suggest that while L-theanine may have some relaxing effects under resting conditions, neither L-theanine not alprazolam demonstrate any acute anxiolytic effects under conditions of increased anxiety in the AA model.,There were no noticeable changes in the alpha bands activity, heart rate, visual attentional performance, and reaction time response in the group with minimal anxiety propensity after l-theanine intake., The study evaluated the effect of l-theanine on attention and reaction time response. The results showed significant elevated visual attentional performance among high anxiety propensity subjects compared to a placebo.,The study divided subjects into two groups: high anxiety propensity group and the minimal anxiety propensity group. The results demonstrated that l-theanine has a pronounced effect on normal healthy subjects prone to have high anxiety.,L-theanine supplementation did not significantly affect PANSS negative scores, neurocognitive functioning as measured by the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery, general functioning, side effects, or quality of life measures in the patients., L-theanine produced significant reductions on PANSS positive and activation factor scores compared to placebo, indicating an improvement in mood., L-theanine augmentation was associated with reduction of anxiety (measured by the HARS scale).,There was no significant benefit of adjunctive L-theanine for anxiety reduction or insomnia severity, compared to placebo. Also, L-theanine didn't show any significant cognitive effects.,There was no significant benefit of adjunctive L-theanine for anxiety reduction or insomnia severity, compared to placebo.

Also, L-theanine didn't show any significant cognitive effects.,Participants treated with adjunctive L-theanine reported greater self-reported sleep satisfaction than those on placebo.,- L-theanine significantly inhibited the blood-pressure increases in a high-response group, which consisted of participants whose blood pressure increased more than average by a performance of a mental task after placebo intake., The study found that L-theanine reduced the Tension-Anxiety scores as compared with placebo intake. ,The study observed improvements in cognitive functions, as indicated by decreased response latency and error rate in the Stroop test, and enhanced verbal memory and executive function in the Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia (BACS) test after l-theanine administration. These findings fall under the ""Cognition"" label.,The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) scores decreased after l-theanine administration in the unremitted patients at baseline, suggesting an improvement in sleep quality, which corresponds to the ""Sleep Quality"" ,The study reported a decrease in anxiety-trait scores in the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) test after l-theanine administration, which aligns with the ""Anxiety"" label.,The study found that the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-21) score was reduced after l-theanine administration, indicating an improvement in depressive symptoms, which falls under the ""Mood"" label.,The study found that verbal fluency and executive function scores improved after L-theanine administration, indicating an improvement in cognitive functions.,he study found that Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) scores decreased after L-theanine administration, indicating an improvement in sleep quality., The study found that State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-trait scores decreased after L-theanine administration, indicating a reduction in anxiety symptoms.,The study found that Self-rating Depression Scale, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-trait scores decreased after L-theanine administration, indicating a reduction in stress-related symptoms.,While the abstract does not explicitly mention the term ""calmness"" or ""relaxation"", the results suggest that L-Theanine could cause anti-stress effects via the inhibition of cortical neuron excitation. This could potentially be interpreted as inducing a state of calmness, but without explicit mention or measurement of calmness or relaxation in the study, this categorization is uncertain.,The study examined the effects of L-Theanine on psychological and physiological states under stress, using a mental arithmetic task as an acute stressor. The results showed that L-Theanine intake resulted in a reduction in the heart rate and salivary immunoglobulin A responses to an acute stress task relative to the placebo control condition. This suggests that L-Theanine could cause anti-stress effects via the inhibition of cortical neuron excitation.,However, those with high stress levels before the practice were more anxious and slept less, regardless of whether they took theanine or a placebo.,However, those with high stress levels before the practice were more anxious and slept less, regardless of whether they took theanine or a placebo.,Higher pre-practice sAA was correlated to shorter sleeping time in both groups. It's uncertain because the study does not explicitly mention an improvement in sleep duration due to theanine intake, but it does suggest a correlation between stress (measured by sAA) and sleep duration.,Students with higher pre-practice sAA showed significantly higher trait anxiety in both groups. Theanine intake seems to have reduced anxiety, as indicated by lower sAA levels., Theanine intake had an anti-stress effect on students. The low levels of pre-practice sAA and subjective stress in the theanine-group suggest that theanine intake suppressed initial stress response of students assigned for a long-term commitment of pharmacy practice.,This study shows that drinking beverages containing both L-Theanine, a compound found in tea, and caffeine, can make you think faster, improve your memory, and make you feel less tired, more alert and experience fewer headaches. ,L-Theanine and caffeine in combination led to improvements in rapid visual information processing accuracy, mental fatigue ratings, simple reaction time, numeric working memory reaction time, sentence verification accuracy, and delayed word recognition reaction time.

(https://www.notion.so/While-the-abstract-does-not-explicitly-mention-the-term-calmness-or-relaxation-the-results-sugg-20f86831557545e3bfa263b2598f2e7d?pvs=21), The study examined the effects of L-Theanine on psychological and physiological states under stress, using a mental arithmetic task as an acute stressor. The results showed that L-Theanine intake resulted in a reduction in the heart rate and salivary immunoglobulin A responses to an acute stress task relative to the placebo control condition. This suggests that L-Theanine could cause anti-stress effects via the inhibition of cortical neuron excitation.

It's uncertain because the study does not explicitly mention an improvement in sleep duration due to theanine intake, but it does suggest a correlation between stress (measured by sAA) and sleep duration. (https://www.notion.so/Higher-pre-practice-sAA-was-correlated-to-shorter-sleeping-time-in-both-groups-It-s-uncertain-becau-2d206c80651c4f6daea0a89539f86e20?pvs=21), Students with higher pre-practice sAA showed significantly higher trait anxiety in both groups.

The low levels of pre-practice sAA and subjective stress in the theanine-group suggest that theanine intake suppressed initial stress response of students assigned for a long-term commitment of pharmacy practice.
